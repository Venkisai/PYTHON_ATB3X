#here ^ function is shows that for same values it is '0' and for different values it is true and some value
#for x=10 it converts 10 into binary i.e, 1010 for ^ it returns 0101 i.e, '3'
#How it is 1010 ^ 1001 = 0011 is 3
#and for 1010 ^ 1010 = 0000 is 0
#1000 ^ 1010 = 0010 is 2
#A = 0 0 1 1
#B = 0 1 0 1
#OR  0 1 1 1 here any one object is 1 it is 1 else 0
#XOR 0 1 1 0 for two different objects it is 1 and for same values it is 0
